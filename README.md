sleipnir
========

This repository contains the necessary programs to implement the diode readout, Sleipnir.

1. The directory /bin/ contains binaries necessary to interface the hardware with the CLASS system-software architecture. These binaries are ready for deployment.
2. The /dev/ directory contains an account of my development processes, and should only be used for educational purposes.
